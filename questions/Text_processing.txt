[Question Start]In the context of BPE tokenization, what is the significance of merging less frequent pairs before more frequent ones during the training phase?[Question End]

[Question Start]What role do morphemes play in subword tokenization methods like BPE and why are they often represented as part of a token in text processed by such algorithms? [Question End]

[Question Start]In the context of NLP, how might sentence segmentation impact the effectiveness of a byte pair encoding token learner and what precautions can be taken to avoid any negative impact of mis-segmented sentences on the learning process?[Question End]

[Question Start]What is the role of the Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) token learner algorithm in text preprocessing for NLP?
A) It separates punctuation from words.
B) It normalizes case folding, making everything lowercase or uppercase as needed.
C) It learns subword tokens that can represent frequent word subparts and are often morphemes
D) It performs full stemming of the words in a corpus.[Question End]

[Question Start]Based on the function `get_splits`, what does the dictionary created by this function represent? Can you provide an example of a key and its associated value in the output of this function for the input `pretokenize([["apple", "banana", "apple"], ["apple"]])`?

Code Snippet:
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import Dict, Tuple

def get_splits(corpus: List[List[str]]) -> Dict[Tuple[str], int]:
    """Get subword splits of tokens in a corpus.
    
    Args:
        corpus (List[List[str]]): A list of sentences where each sentence is represented
            as a list of tokens.

    Returns:
        Dict[Tuple[str], int]: A dictionary where keys are tuples representing subword splits
            and values are the counts of occurrences of those splits in the corpus.
    
    Example: 
        >>> corpus = [["apple", "banana", "apple"], ["apple"]]
        >>> get_splits(corpus)
        {('a', 'p', 'p', 'l', 'e', '</w>'): 3, ('b', 'a', 'n', 'a', 'n', 'a', '</w>'): 1}
