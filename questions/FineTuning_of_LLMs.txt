[Question Start]In few-shot learning, what's the difference between zero-shot and few-shot prompting, and why might one be more effective than the other for certain tasks? [Question End]

[Question Start]How does prefix tuning differ from parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRa, in terms of their approach to updating parameters while maintaining model efficiency?[Question End]

[Question Start]In an NLP context, what are some potential advantages and disadvantages of fine-tuning a large pre-trained LLM on a specific task rather than starting with a model trained directly for the target task from scratch?[Question End]

[Question Start]What is the low-rank assumption in LoRa (Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models) and how does it help with fine-tuning these models?
A) It assumes that only a few new parameters are needed to adapt the model, reducing the computational resources required during training.
B: It assumes the update weight matrix contains just as much information as the original weights, requiring no reduction in dimensionality or computation.
C: It assumes the update weight matrix is of higher rank than the original weights, actually increasing the complexity and parameters of the fine-tuned model. 
D: It makes no assumptions about the weight matrices' ranks, making the approach computationally intensive like a full parameter update.[Question End]
