[Question Start]What is the purpose of normalizing term frequencies in the TF-IDF method?[Question End]

[Question Start]In the given example, what are the calculated TF-IDF values for "a" and "linux", respectively? [Question End]

[Question Start]Why would a term with an inverse document frequency of 0 not be useful for distinguishing between documents in this context?[Question End]

[Question Start]What is the effect of a high term frequency and low document frequency on a word's TF-IDF value in a text corpus?
A) The value will be low, as high tf and low df could indicate the word is common within a single document but not very important across the entire corpus.
B) The value will be moderate, as the high tf somewhat offsets the low df.
C) The value will be high, as a high tf and a low df may suggest the word is particularly significant to one specific document in the corpus.
D) It's impossible to say without more information on the inverse document frequency values.[Question End]

[Question Start]Based on the given excerpt, a potential question could be: 

In the 'TfIdfModel' class, what is the purpose of the 'df_vector' and how is it computed from the 'term_doc_matrix'? 
Code snippet for reference:
```python
df_vector = np.zeros(len(self.index))
# Fill the matrix and compute the tfidf matrix
raise NotImplementedError()
```[Question End]
