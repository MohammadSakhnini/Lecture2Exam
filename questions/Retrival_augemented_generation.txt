[Question Start]What are the key differences between a retrieval-based approach and a keyword search in an NLP context, especially in relation to the RAG system? [Question End]

[Question Start]How can multi-armed bandit theory be leveraged in hybrid document retrieval for a RAG system, given user feedback on relevancy of retrieved documents?[Question End]

[Question Start]In a corporate environment, what are some potential challenges or special considerations when implementing an NLP RAG system and how might these require adaptations to the standard approach? [Question End]

[Question Start]How can intermediate queries improve the effectiveness of the interaction between users, document retrieval, and LLMs in a RAG system?[Question End]

[Question Start]What is the primary motivation behind using a Retrieval-Augmented Generator (RAG) in natural language processing, and what key components does it consist of?
A) To reduce computation time and resources; vector search and document retrieval
B) To increase context length and handle larger datasets; LLMs and multi-head attention
C) To improve the understanding of visual content and tables in documents; computer vision models and table parsing algorithms
D) To personalize text generation for different users; user modeling and reinforcement learning[Question End]
