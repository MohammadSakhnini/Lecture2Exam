[Question Start]What is the main reason why a simple feedforward neural language model often performs almost as well as more complex models in predicting the next word in a sequence? 
A) The use of embeddings for words allows the network to find semantic similarities.
B) It only considers a fixed number of prior words through sliding windows, limiting complexity. 
C) It is easier and faster to train compared to more complex architectures. 
D) It does not suffer from the vanishing gradient problem that can affect recurrent neural networks.[Question End]

[Question Start]Based on the implementation of the `OneHotEncoder` class and its `encode` method in the lecture content, what would be a proper way to call the `encode` function for the token with index 5 (assuming our tokenizer's vocabulary size is 20), and what should be the shape of the output tensor?```python
# Assuming that we've created an instance of OneHotEncoder:
encoder = OneHotEncoder(vocab_size=20)
# To get a one-hot encoded vector for the token at index 5, we would call our method as follows:
encoding = encoder.encode(5)
# And the shape of this output tensor should be (20,) which indicates that there are 20 elements in the vector, matching the size of our assumed vocabulary.
