In the context of NLP, this can be utilized for tasks such as spam classification, sentiment analysis, and moderation systems. For example, a spam classifier can determine whether an email is spam or not spam (ham) by analyzing its content and features.\\n\\nSentiment analysis, on the other hand, focuses on determining the emotional tone or attitude conveyed in a piece of text. This is essential for understanding public opinion, customer feedback, and overall sentiment towards a product or service. By categorizing text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments, sentiment analysis provides insights into how people feel about different subjects.\\n\\nBoth text classification and sentiment analysis are crucial in NLP as they allow computers to process and interpret human language in a way that mimics human understanding. These tasks form the basis for various applications such as social media monitoring, customer service analysis, and product feedback analysis. By implementing text classification and sentiment analysis algorithms, machines can analyze and derive meaning from vast amounts of textual data, enabling more effective communication and decision-making.']\n",

      "LLM Answer: ['In the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), several common challenges are encountered during various tasks. \\n\\n1. Ambiguities: One of the significant challenges in NLP is dealing with language ambiguities, such as homonyms. For example, the word \"bank\" can refer to a financial institution or the side of a river. Resolving such ambiguities accurately is crucial for NLP systems to provide correct interpretations.\\n\\n2. Computation Issues: NLP tasks often involve complex computations, especially when dealing with large datasets or advanced algorithms like neural networks. These tasks can be computationally intensive, requiring significant processing power and time to train models effectively.\\n\\n3. Dataset Sizes: Another challenge in NLP is the availability and size of datasets. Having a small or biased dataset can limit the performance and generalizability of NLP models. For instance, sentiment analysis models trained on a dataset predominantly consisting of positive sentiment may struggle to accurately detect negative sentiments.\\n\\n4. Biases: NLP systems can inherit biases present in the training data, leading to biased outcomes. For example, a sentiment analysis model trained on social media data may reflect the biases present in those platforms, potentially amplifying stereotypes or discrimination.\\n\\nTo illustrate these challenges in practical NLP applications:\\n- Ambiguities: In a text classification task, distinguishing between product reviews that contain sarcasm or nuanced language can be challenging for sentiment analysis models, leading to misinterpretations.\\n- Computation Issues: Machine translation tasks, especially for translating between complex languages, require significant computational resources for accurate and timely translations.\\n- Dataset Sizes: Developing a speech-to-text model for a specific regional accent may be challenging if there is a limited dataset available for training, impacting the model\\'s accuracy.\\n- Biases: In a chatbot used for customer support, biases in the training data may result in the chatbot providing incorrect or discriminatory responses to users from certain demographics.\\n\\nAddressing these challenges is crucial for advancing the capabilities of NLP systems and ensuring their ethical and effective use in various applications.']\n",

Document embeddings represent the high-dimensional representation of each document in a more compact form, capturing the semantic meaning of the text.\\n\\n- `labels_train`: A 1-dimensional numpy array where each element corresponds to the rating (stars) of the review from the training set.

After training the model on `embed_train` and `labels_train`, the model learns to map the embeddings to the corresponding ratings.

This function is essential for converting words into numerical vectors, enabling mathematical operations on words for various NLP tasks.\\n\\n2. `cosine_similarity(vec1: np.ndarray, vec2: np.ndarray) -> float`: This method calculates the cosine similarity between two given vectors.
