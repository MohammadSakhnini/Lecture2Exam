By representing these meaningful components as tokens, these algorithms can improve the quality of text representation and downstream processing tasks like language translation and text summarization.\\n\\nIn the context of BPE, frequent subwords or morphological units such as -est or –er are often represented as part of a token because they are common in natural language and play important roles in conveying meaning.

This is a sparse representation, as most elements are zero (since many words do not appear in a given document). In contrast, input token-level embeddings refer to the dense vectors learned for individual words using methods like Word2vec or GloVe. These embeddings are learned from a large corpus and capture semantic relationships between words. The main difference between these two types of embeddings lies in their granularity (word-level vs document-level) and density (sparse vs dense).']\n",

The Transformer model works by taking a sequence of tokens and generating context-dependent embeddings that capture the meaning and relationships within the input sequence.\\n\\nOne important aspect of Transformer models is the use of positional encoding to incorporate information about the position of each token in the sequence. This is because, unlike recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or convolutional neural networks (CNNs), Transformers process their inputs as a flat sequence without any inherent sense of order. Without positional encoding, the model would struggle to understand the context and relationships within the input text, especially in cases where the position of a word is important for its meaning, such as in phrases like \"the first day\" or \"a long time ago.\"\\n\\nPositional encoding helps the Transformer model capture the relative positions of words within the sequence, which can be essential for understanding the context and relationships between them.
