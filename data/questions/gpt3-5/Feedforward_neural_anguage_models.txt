[Question Start]How would you differentiate between manual feature engineering and using embeddings in a sentiment classifier? Provide examples of features in each approach and discuss the potential limitations and benefits of each method.[Question End]

[Question Start]Explain the process of building a sentiment classifier using a simple Feedforward Neural Network based on embeddings. Discuss the architecture of the network, including the input layer, hidden layers, output layer, and the role of word embeddings in sentiment classification.[Question End]

[Question Start]In the context of neural language models, discuss the significance of predicting the next word in a sequence given prior words. Explain the concept of sliding windows in feedforward neural language models and how they contribute to enhancing the model's ability to generate coherent text.[Question End]

[Question Start]### Question

Why do neural language models work better than N-gram language models in predicting the next word in a sequence?

- Neural LMs can use word embeddings to generalize from similar words
- N-gram LMs can handle longer sequences more efficiently
- Neural LMs rely on manual feature engineering for prediction
- N-gram LMs have a higher capacity for learning complex patterns[Question End]

[Question Start]```python
# Implement the encode method in the OneHotEncoder class to encode a single token ID as a one-hot encoded tensor.

class OneHotEncoder:
    
    def __init__(self, vocab_size: int):
        self.vocab_size = vocab_size
        
    def encode(self, token_id: int) -> tensor:
        """
        Encode a single token ID as a one-hot encoded tensor.

        Args:
            token_id (int): The token ID to be encoded.

        Returns:
            tensor: The one-hot encoded tensor representing the input token ID.
        """
        # YOUR CODE HERE
        raise NotImplementedError()
```

What is the purpose of the `encode` method in the `OneHotEncoder` class based on the provided code snippet?[Question End]
