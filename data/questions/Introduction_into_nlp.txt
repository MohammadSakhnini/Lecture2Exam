[Question Start]How have neural network-based approaches revolutionized NLP tasks such as text generation and machine translation in recent years?[Question End]

[Question Start]Based on the lecture content about NLP and its many applications, which of the following is NOT mentioned as a primary task of the field?

A) Text classification for spam filtering
B) Generating coherent text based on a given context
C) Turning sound into written text (Speech-to-text)
D) The automatic creation of visual art from textual prompts
(Note: While modern AI can generate impressive images, the idea that it could yet accurately translate text to visual content is overstated and remains in the realm of science fiction for now.)[Question End]

[Question Start]Given the following code snippet from StopWordKeywordExtractor class:

```python
class StopWordKeywordExtractor:
    # ...
    def is_proper_word(self, token:str) -> bool:
        ''' 
        Checks if the word is a proper word by our definition 
        Arguments: 
            token     -- The token as a string 
        Return: 
            is_proper -- True / False
        '''
        match = re.search(r'\b(\w{2,})\b', token)
        return match and token == match[0]
```

Question: What is the purpose of the regular expression `r'\b(\w{2,})\b'` in the is_proper_word function?[Question End]
