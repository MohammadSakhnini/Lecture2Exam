[Question Start]What is the main advantage of a Bidirectional RNN as compared to a unidirectional one for NLP tasks?
A) It can only process data in one direction, which may limit its understanding of context.
B) It's less computationally expensive than a bidirectional model.
C) It captures context from both past and future time points, improving the performance on many NLP tasks
D) It is easier to train as it has fewer connections to learn. [IDE][Question End]
