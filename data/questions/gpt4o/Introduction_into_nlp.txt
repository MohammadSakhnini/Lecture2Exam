[Question Start]### Question: Understanding Named Entity Recognition and POS Tagging with spaCy

Consider the following code snippet that uses spaCy to perform Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging on a given text. Based on your understanding of spaCy and the lecture content, answer the questions that follow:

```python
import spacy

# Load the English language model
nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')

# Sample input text
text = 'Apple is looking at buying U.K. startup for $1 billion.'

# Parse the input text
doc = nlp(text)

# Extract named entities
entities = [(ent.text, ent.label_) for ent in doc.ents]

# Extract POS tags and their corresponding words
pos_tags = [(token.text, token.pos_) for token in doc]

print("Named Entities:", entities)
print("POS Tags:", pos_tags)
```

#### Questions:

1. What are Named Entities, and how does spaCy identify them in the provided code?
2. Explain the significance of the `nlp` object in the code snippet. What role does it play in processing the text?
3. Based on the code provided, what are the named entities identified in the sample input text, and what are their respective labels?
4. Describe the output of the `pos_tags` list comprehension. What kind of information does it contain about the tokens in the text?
5. The text contains "U.K." and "$1 billion." as parts of the sentence. How does spaCy typically handle abbreviations and numerical values in terms of tokenization and named entity recognition?
