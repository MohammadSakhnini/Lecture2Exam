[Question Start]### QUESTION

What is the primary advantage of using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in natural language processing tasks?

- It allows for the parallel processing of sequences.
- It reduces the context size by selecting only relevant documents.
- It replaces the need for token embeddings in transformer models.
- It eliminates the need for attention mechanisms in language models.[Question End]
