[Question Start]```python
# Suppose you are asked to create a method within the BigramModel class to calculate the unigram probability for a given word. 
# How would you implement this method based on the given code snippet?

def unigram_probability(self, word:str) -> float:
    '''
    Returns the unigram probability for the word.
    If the word does not exist in our corpus, return 0.

    Arguments:
        word        -- word we want to know the probability of
    Returns:
        probability -- how likely it is to choose the word at random
    '''
    # YOUR CODE HERE
    raise NotImplementedError()
```

Explain how you would implement the `unigram_probability` method within the `BigramModel` class based on the provided code snippet from the lecture content.[Question End]
