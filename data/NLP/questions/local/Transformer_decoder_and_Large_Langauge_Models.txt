[Question Start]Which of the following statements is true regarding the process discussed in "Learning to summarize from human feedback" by Stiennon et al (OpenAI), 2022?
A) The researchers only used non-expert judges for evaluation.
B) The summaries were not posted on a public platform for evaluation but assessed solely in-house.
C) Both expert and non-expert judges evaluated the summaries, giving them rewards based on quality as perceived by their respective levels of expertise. 
D) The model was only fine-tuned once after collecting the initial batch of human feedback.[Question End]
