Creating exam questions is tedious for professors and often time-consuming, distracting them from their primary responsibilities of teaching and research. Developing a large language model (LLM) pipeline to generate exam questions from lecture notes aims to streamline this process and enhance efficiency and accuracy. This automated solution ensures a comprehensive coverage of course material and produces high-quality, consistent questions. It allows customization to suit different question formats and difficulty levels. Ultimately, this pipeline should enable educators to focus more on student engagement and the quality of instruction rather than stressing about exam questions.
