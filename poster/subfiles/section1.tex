   Creating exam questions is tedious for professors and time-consuming, distracting them from their primary
   responsibilities of teaching and researching. Developing a large language model (LLM) pipeline to generate exam
questions from lecture notes aims to streamline this process, enhancing efficiency and accuracy. This automated
solution ensures comprehensive coverage of course material and produces high-quality, consistent questions.
It allows customization to suit different question formats and difficulty levels. Ultimately, this pipeline should
enable educators to focus more on student engagement and the quality of instruction, rather than stressing about
the exam questions.
