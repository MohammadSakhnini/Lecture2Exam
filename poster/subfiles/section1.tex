   Creating exam questions is tedious for the professors and often time-consuming, detracting from their primary responsibilities of teaching and research. Developing a large language model (LLM) pipeline to generate exam questions from lecture notes aims to streamline this process, enhancing efficiency and accuracy. This automated solution ensures comprehensive coverage of course material, producing high-quality, consistent questions. It allows customization to suit different question formats and difficulty levels. Ultimately, this pipeline should enable educators to focus more on student engagement and the quality of instruction, rather than stressing about the exam questions.
